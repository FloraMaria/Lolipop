# Lolipop
A command-line interface for searching through and torrenting from nyaa.se

## Documentation
### Dependencies
Requests

urllib

lxml

python-libtorrent

HTMLParser

###Usage
The program itself will guide you through how to use it. It is very straightforward. Torrented files are saved in the same location as the script.

###Development
I have documented how the script works inside the code itself. Feel free to do whatever you want with it! Nyaa.se didn't have an api so the methods I used to get html data could work for a myriad of other sites.

###Why?
I wanted a challenge. I wanted to see if I could interact with a site without an api.
